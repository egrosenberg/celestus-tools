                    The character sheet header is a vertical scrollable element that contains much of the most
                    basic
                    and essential information about a character. The character sheet header is broken into seven
                    sections:

                    <p>
                        The first section of the character sheet contains basic character info. This includes the
                        character's portrait, name, creature type, level, exhaustion, movement, and initiative.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The character portrait has a small gear icon in the bottom right corner, clicking on this
                        will
                        open a configuration menu where you can toggle an optional portrait frame as well as change
                        the
                        actor's token's pointer color.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The character name field is a simple text input field where you can input a character's
                        name.
                        The creature type field is a searchable dropdown that can be used to select the creature's
                        type
                        from the list of all possible creature types.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Following the creature type is four individual labels containing various pieces of
                        information
                        on the character.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The character level is an editable text field that can be changed to level up or down a
                        character. Changing its value will automatically alter the character's memorization
                        abilities,
                        attribute and ability points available, as well as any other variables tied to character
                        level.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The exhaustion level is also an editable text field which will automatically apply the
                        effects
                        of exhaustion.
                        Any exhaustion levels are automatically removed upon using the rest button.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both the movement and initiative fields are automatically calculated and cannot be directly
                        edited.
                        Clicking the initiative will automatically add the actor to combat and roll initiative so
                        long
                        as it has an owned active token.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, there are three icons: refresh, rest, and combat. Hitting the refresh button will
                        trigger a standard refresh of resources for ending a scene (health, armor, normal
                        cooldowns).
                        The second button triggers the effects of a rest. The third icon is an indicator of whether
                        or
                        not the character is currently involved in a combat.

                        in a list. Hovering over a skill's icon will display a tooltip with the name of the skill.
                        Clicking on a skill's icon will bring up a dialog that allows you to use the skill. If a
                        skill requires more than one memory slot, there will be a number of gray brain icons to
                        represent the additional memory slots it costs. There will also be a small icon in the bottom
                        left corner of a skill icon that shows which school the skill belongs to, if the skill is
                        unmemorized there will instead be numbers next to icons to describe the skill's memorization
                        requirements.

                        edit it, and the trash can icon can be clicked to delete the skill. You can also right click the

            The items tab is where you can manage any physical inventory items your character might have. There are two
            main sections of the items tab. At the top of the tab is a large section displaying a character's currently
            equipped gear, the rest of the items tab display's all of a character's items and currency.
        </div>
        <h3 class="ul-amber">Equipped Gear</h3>
        <p>
            The first section of the equipped gear tab is a large area that shows each equipment slot and what the
            character currently has equipped in each slot. Clicking on one of the slots opens up a small popup wherein
            you can click on another piece of gear to equip it into that slot. Right clicking on a piece of gear in this
            section will open up the item sheet for that piece of gear.
        </p>
        <h3 class="ul-amber">Currency</h3>
        <p>
            Below the equipped gear is a small section that lists each currency type and the character's current balance
            of that coinage. Hovering over the coin icon for a type of currency will show the coin type's name. Each
            currency has a text input field that can be used to modify a character's current balance. Any math formulas
            entered will be automatically calculated and starting an input with a plus or minus symbol will either add
            or subtract that value to the character's total.
        </p>
        <h3 class="ul-amber">Inventory Lists</h3>
        <p>
            The rest of the items page consists of itemized lists of each type of equipment a character can have.

        <h4 class="amber">Armor List</h4>

            The first inventory list is the armor list. The header describes the function of each column and at its end
            is a button that allows you to create a new armor item on the character sheet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each item is represented by a single row in the armor list. At the beginning of each entry is the item's
            icon, left clicking this icon will create a chat message describing the item and right clicking it will open
            its item sheet. Beside the icon is the item's name.
            Clicking an item's name will drop down the item's description below it. The second column of an armor entry
            is its armor value, this is shown as its physical and magic armor values beside each other. The final column
            of an armor entry is the item controls, the shield icon can be used to equip or unequip a piece of armor,
            the notepad icon can be used to open its item sheet, and the trashcan icon can be used to delete it.
        </p>

        <p>
            The second inventory list is the weapons list. This list is functionally the same as the armor list except
            the value column displays a breakdown of the weapon's damage (calculated without damage bonuses).
        </p>
        <h4 class="amber">Offhands List</h4>

        </div>
        <p>
            The third inventory list is the offhands list. It functions the exact same as the armor list.
        </p>
        <h4 class="amber">Consumables List</h4>
        <div class="image-wide section">

        </div>
        <p>
            The third inventory list is the consumables list. It functions similarly to the lists before it except
            instead of having a value column it has a quantity column. There is a text field to input a quantity or you
            can use the plus and minus buttons beside the input to change the quantity.

                than equip an item. As effects don't possess descriptions in the same way items do, left clicking an
                effect will not do anything.

                The hotbar or "macro bar" is a feature built into foundry that can allow players and GMs to quickly
                access parts of character sheets, especially skills. Clicking on a macro corresponding to a skill or
                item will achieve the same effect as clicking them on the character sheet. Hovering over a macro
                associated with an item or skill will show the skill / item's description in the top right corner of the
                play area.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are two main ways to had skills or items to a player's hotbar. One option is to individually drag
                skills and items from the character sheet onto the hotbar. The other method is to click the button with
                the brain icon that is beside the hotbar. Clicking this button will automatically populate your hotbar
                with all currently memorized skills. This function is especially useful for GMs who may want to quickly
                see and use skills known by npcs without having to open their sheets.

        Using a Skill
    </h2>
    <div class="collapsible active" id="collapse-using-skill">
        <div class="section">
            <p>
                Using a skill is one of the most common things you will do while playing a game of Celestus. The process
                for
                using a skill is one that is fairly straightforward. For more information on skills, check out the
                <a href="/content/quickstart#skills">quickstart guide</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are two ways to use a skill in celestus: through the skills tab on a character's sheet, or by
                clicking the skill's macro on the hotbar while controlling the character's token. No matter how you
                initiate the process of using a skill, the rest of the process is the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you click on a skill, you will first be prompted if you would like to use the skill's resources.
                Hitting no to this prompt will cause the skill to not consume action points or focus points. Skills will
                not consume action points regardless of which option you pick if the character is not currently in
                initiative. If for some reason the character is unable to use the skill, a warning will pop up in this
                message alerting the user of why the skill is unavailable. If you wish to use a skill that a character
                does not have the resources for or otherwise would be unable to use, you can always answer "no" to the
                use resources prompt. You can also answer "no" if you simply want to post the skill's description in
                chat. If you answer "no" to the use resources prompt, the chat message skill description will have a
                blue background to signify no resources were spent.

                        the character who used the skill as well as the player responsible for that character using it,
                        a description of the skill, and buttons that can be used to perform the required actions of the
                        skill. The only users that can activate these buttons are those who have ownership over the
                        character that used the skill, or those with Game Master privileges.

                    <p>
                        Some skills may require an attack roll. In order to perform an attack roll, the attacker must
                        first target all tokens they are attempting to attack. To do so, either use the foundry
                        targeting tool or press t (or shift + t) while mousing over the token you would like to target.
                        Once you have targeted all characters you would like to attack, click the button that says "Roll
                        Attack".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once an attack has been rolled, a chat message will be created showing the result. The outcome
                        of the attack will be automatically calculated and the color of the die result indicates whether
                        the attack hit (green), missed (red), or was a critical hit (blue).

                        Some skills may require have a damage component. To roll the damage of a skill, click the "Roll
                        Damage" button. The game will automatically roll the skill's damage dice and calculating the
                        applicable damage multipliers. Once the damage has been rolled, a chat message will be created
                        with the roll results as well as the damage total and a breakdown of each damage type and value.

                    <p>
                        You can apply skill damage to characters by selecting their token and clicking apply damage. If
                        you would like to apply damage with a multiplier you can click one of the multipliers below the
                        apply damage button instead. If you would like to only apply one damage component at a time, you
                        can hover over the damage component and click the damage multiplier you would like to apply
                        (clicking 1 will will apply the base damage of that component).

                <p>
                    Some skills apply status effects to their targets. In order to apply a skill's statuses, first
                    select all of the character's tokens you want to apply the statuses to, and then click "Apply
                    Statuses". The game will automatically check if the status will be resisted by armor, so there is no
                    need to manually check.
                </p>
                <h3 class="ul-aqua">Area of Effect Skills</h3>
                <p>
                    Some skills will specify an are of creatures they affect. For these skills, there will be a button
                    labeled "Draw Template". Clicking this button will create a template of the area of effect to follow
                    your cursor until you left click on the canvas (or right click to cancel). Once you click the
                    location you want to place the template, the game will create a temporary measured template on the
                    map showing the total area of effect of the skill. Some skills create surfaces, if this is the case,
                    the game will instead create a special surface template that can apply effects or interact with
                    other surfaces. Be careful with surfaces as once you place them it can be difficult to undo their
                    effects.
                </p>
                <h3 class="ul-aqua">Complex Skills</h3>
                <p>
                    Some skills have extra complex effects to automate them. For example,
                    <a class="content-link" data-uuid="Compendium.celestus.skills.rrxB9WzXIzYMJUTW"
                        data-id="rrxB9WzXIzYMJUTW">Shed Skin</a> resets the cooldown of all combat abilities.
                    Because the automation of these skills is so out of the ordinary, they will have custom scripts to
                    be run. These scripts often have effects that are difficult to undo, so be extra careful when
                    executing them (the game will warn you of this every time you attempt to do so). When a skill of
                    this type comes up, there will be a button labeled "Execute Skill" that only shows up for Game
                    Masters. A Game Master can click this button to execute the special effects of the skill.

                The battlemap is where you will spend most all of combat. The Celestus system for Foundry introduces

                    <h3 class="ul-aqua">Directionality</h3>
                    <p>
                        When playing Celestus using a map the direction a character is facing may be relevant. In order
                        handle this, Celestus adds semi-transparent pointers to each token on the map that indicate the
                        direction it is facing. The direction of this point will automatically change to face the
                        direction the token moves. The pointer will also change direction if it's character used a skill
                        that places a template or rolls an attack. You can manually readjust the direction a token is
                        facing by selecting it and pressing ctrl+alt+d which will cause the token to point towards
                        wherever your cursor is.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="ul-aqua">Backstabs and Attack Range</h3>
                    <p>
                        Some skills are capable of backstabbing, causing an instant crit if the attack hits. Because of
                        this it is important to visualize where a token can be standing in order to be able to backstab
                        a creature. When you hover over a token, an overlay will appear. Part of this overlay is a knife
                        symbol and a blue cone. This blue cone represents the angle at which a character must be within
                        in order backstab that token.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many skills or effects will refer to a characters reach or "melee range". As Celestus is
                        designed to be played on a gridless map, it can be difficult to determine a character's reach
                        quickly. This is why part of the token hover overlay is a white circle that represents the
                        character's reach. Any token that dips into that circle is considered within the token's melee
                        range.

            <h3 class="ul-aqua">Teleporting</h3>
            <p>
                Some skills will allow a character to teleport. This can cause some issues if you simply drag your
                character. They may get stuck on a wall, or even worse, you may drag them through a surface an
                accidentally apply a status that character shouldn't have. Because of this, the Celestus system has a
                special shortcut to teleport tokens. The default keybind is ctrl+alt+t but you can change the keybind in
                the game settings. Select a token and enter the key combination and you will initiate the teleport. A
                purple spinning wheel will follow your cursor until you left or right click on the canvas. Left clicking
                will finalize the teleport and right clicking will cancel the teleport.

                It can be a hassle to constantly open your character to monitor or modify resources during combat.
                Fortunately you don't have to. At the bottom right of the user interface is a widget that displays all
                of a character's resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                The action point and focus point symbols function the same as they do on a character sheet. The armor
                and health values have text fields you can use to change the character's current value of that resource.
                If your input starts with an addition or subtraction it will instead add or subtract the following
                expression from the character's health / armor pool.

                When you're in combat, you may want to know the status of the combatants. To quickly view the state of a
                combatant you can mouse over the token. Doing such causes a widget to appear in the top center of the
                user interface. This interface contains their current and max armor and health as well as any statuses
                affecting them. If you wish for this to "lock in" on a token you can right click or middle click the
                token (if you are the token's owner you can only middle click the actor).
